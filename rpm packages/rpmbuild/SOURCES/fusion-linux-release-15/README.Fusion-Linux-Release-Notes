Fusion Linux 15 "GNOME 3 Fusion" release notes

/About Fusion Linux/

Fusion Linux is a Fedora Remix that uses a combination of free and open-source, non-free and non-open-source firmware and software, to bring the user the most advanced experience on the Linux platform.

Fusion Linux includes an outstanding theme, multimedia functionality out of the box and added desktop tweaks for better usability. 

And finally, Fusion Linux is 100% compatible with Fedora. :)

/About this release/

Guiding principles behind this release were “Beyond Upstream” and “Multimedia Out of the Box”. 

Features and highlights are:
* a brand new custom made theme
* Fusion Linux post install welcome wizard script
* Skype removed so Fusion Linux can be freely redistributed
* multimedia support out of the box (Flash, MP3 & DivX playback)
* better hardware compatibility for broadcom wireless cards
* better games selection

We put a lot of work in the brand new custom made theme. It is based on Faenza icons and Alliance GTK theme with the little Fusion touch.

Software included:
* mintMenu 
* DockbarX
* GNOME Do
* Compiz Fusion

mintMenu and DockbarX are two GNOME panel addons that make this Linux distro unique. These are the most obvious features that you will encounter first time you login.
